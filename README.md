This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon bug in ActionScript 3 related to the trace() statement. The bug manifests as inconsistent output when the trace() statement is placed within a function that's called frequently.  The issue appears to stem from the internal timing of the ActionScript virtual machine and its interaction with the trace output mechanism under high function call frequency. The solution shows a workaround that uses a more robust logging method.
